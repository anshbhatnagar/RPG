# RPG
Hello! This is my hobby project trying to make an RPG!

I'm not sure why you would want this code but the dependencies are [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [nlohmann JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

The controls are E to interact, F to fire a fireball, and left mouse click to attack (should probably add a guide in the game itself)
